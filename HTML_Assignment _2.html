<h1>Patrick Young</h1>
<p>
      I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before comming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of MBA). At Taligent, I worked on places of Project         Teams, a  groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was  fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughtout an entire      software lifecycle--- from initial product conception throught the actual product launch.

<p>
      I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on processsupport for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree         from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
