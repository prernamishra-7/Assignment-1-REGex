 <h3>My Trip To California</h3>

<p>
       It was a long, quick trip. We loaaded our vehical and headed to Northern California for the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain. By the time we returned             home, We had travelled some 1,300 miles in three and one half day.

<h3>My Trip To The Rockies</h3>

<p>
       After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Academy, Pikes Peak, Garden of the Gods, and the Olympic training                 centre. We chartered a bs to the Philmont Scout Ranch in Northern New Mexico and began our 60 miles backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded Amtrack's and rode the rails to Kingman, and then                 chartered a bus home.

<h3>My Trip To The Mid West</h3>

       My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvaoo, illinois, and Detroit, Michi gan. We then boarded            Amtrak in Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City, where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
